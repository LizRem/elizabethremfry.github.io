I hold an MRes in Health Data in Practice from QMUL, a MSc in Global Health from the University of Copenhagen, and a BSc in Psychology from University of Exeter. 

:computer: My research focuses on utilising clinical language models in healthcare and ensuring that models are built in collaboration with patients and healthcare professionals.

:seedling: I also work as a researcher for [We and AI](https://weandai.org/) looking at the societal impact of AI, particularly generative AI, has on public good, education, healthcare and other areas.

:orange_book: I run the monthly webinar series for [Data Science for Health Equity Statistical Methods](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/themes/statistical-methods) theme hosting international speakers in deep learning, machine learning and statistical methods in healthcare. Fancy giving us a talk?
